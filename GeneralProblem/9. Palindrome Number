# Palindrome Checker

## Description
This Python script provides a class `Solution` with a method `isPalindrome` to check if a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

## Usage
### `isPalindrome(x)`
- **Parameters:**
  - `x`: Integer - The number to be checked for palindrome.
- **Returns:** 
  - `True` if `x` is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.

## Approach
1. **Check for Negative Numbers:** If the input number is negative, it cannot be a palindrome.
2. **Reverse the Number:** Use a while loop to reverse the number by continuously dividing it by 10 and adding the remainder to the reverse number.
3. **Compare with Original:** Compare the reversed number with the original number. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome.

## Example
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        if x < 0:
            return False
        temp = x
        reverse = 0
        while temp != 0:
            reverse = reverse * 10 + temp % 10
            temp //= 10
        return x == reverse
